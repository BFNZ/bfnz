    <p>Bibles for New Zealand (BFNZ) is a non-profit organization that distributes free Recovery Version Bibles as well as Christian literature throughout New Zealand. Its hope is that people would "come to the full knowledge of the truth" according to God's desire in 1 Timothy 2:4. Bibles for New Zealand primarily offers the Recovery Version of the New Testament published by Living Stream Ministry. The product of over 10 years of extensive research, the New Testament Recovery Version is based on the consummate understanding of the divine revelation. Truths that have been recovered steadily and progressively since Martin Luther's time are brought together in this unique version of the New Testament.
